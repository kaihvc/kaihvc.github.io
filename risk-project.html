          <h4><i>Analyzing Risk Metric Stability between 1950-2020</i></h4>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            From Fall 2021 to Spring 2022, I worked with Dr. David Ikenberry at
            the CU Leeds Business School to do research on how risk to financial
            assets (in particular, stocks) changes over time. We looked at 3 metrics:
            volatility (which is the standard deviation of a stock’s weekly returns),
            correlation between pairs of stocks, and market exposure (essentially,
            how closely a stock’s returns follow the market’s). The particular question
            we were answering was how stable these metrics were between 6-month
            periods, or how far they moved from their previous values.
          </p>
          <h5><i>Technical Details</i></h5>
          <p>
            To do this, we took stocks with a market capitalization over $10mil
            (in 2020 dollars) from 1950 to 2020. We then calculated each metric,
            for each stock, for each 6-month period. Each period’s data was discretized
            into 10 bins, both by decile and standard error. We then used Markov
            modeling to analyze the data’s stability; in short, we calculated the
            probability that a stock would move between a given pair of bins (e.g.
            10 to 9, or 5 to 7) from one period to the next. This probability was
            then visualized using a 10x10 heatmap, with “hotter” colors corresponding
            to higher probabilities.
          </p>
          <h5><i>Tentative Findings</i></h5>
          <p>
            While our results haven’t been fully analyzed/peer reviewed/published
            yet, we have seen some interesting trends in the data. Overall, all
            three metrics tend to be pretty stable between periods; a given stock
            has a high probability of staying in or near the bin it’s currently in.
            Across all three metrics, stability has seemed to increase since 1950,
            with particular increases since 2000. The heatmap results for the entire
            study duration (1950-2020) are displayed below. The top row of graphs
            were discretized by deciles, and the bottom row by standard error. A
            given cell (i, j) contains the probability that a stock moves from bin
            i to bin j from one period to the next.
          </p>
          <p>
            The stability is evident in the strong diagonal line visible in (most of)
            the heatmaps, meaning that a given stock has the highest probability of
            staying in or near its current decile in the next period. The interesting
            case is the graph in the middle of the bottom row, representing correlations
            discretized by standard error - the stability isn't evident until the
            higher deciles, and below about the 5th decile, the strongest tendency
            is for stocks to revert back to the average level of correlation with
            each other. This could mean that strongly correlated stocks are correlated
            because of deeper factors, while weakly correlated (or strongly anticorrelated)
            ones are due to more transient factors.

            This was a really interesting project. The intersection between this
            and my internship at Catfund gave me the chance to see both how research
            gets done in an academic setting, and how the results of that research
            can get applied professionally.
