          <p>
            In Summer 2021 I traveled to Brussels to study the EU and its policy
            process with 12 other exceptional students. I had the unique perspective
            of being the only CS major there, and one of only 2 engineers (the other
            studying environmental); all the others were studying international
            affairs, economics, or political science. For the first few days I felt
            incredibly out of my element. I had none of the PoliSci background that
            everyone else seemed to have - I could barely point to Hungary or Greece
            on a map, much less explain why one was suffering from democratic backsliding
            or how the EU Central Bank’s post-pandemic economic recovery plan would
            affect the other. Luckily, they were more than willing to share their
            knowledge.
          </p>
          <p>
            The conversations we had over coffee and wine at Cafe Belga in one of
            the many open plazas that dot the city, and the whirlwind classes on
            the EU’s political structure, components, & history, helped get me up
            to date by our first interview with a former EU official. By the end,
            I was writing & asking questions for our daily interviews with politicians
            and bureaucrats just as well as any of the others.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to our tours of Brussels & various EU buildings, we got
            the opportunity to travel to Luxembourg, Antwerp, and Bruges. In Luxembourg
            we toured the city, learned its history, and visited the European Court
            of Justice, the EU counterpart to our judicial branch. In Antwerp and
            Bruges, we took even more historical tours, visited museums and clocktowers,
            and learned the local myths of giants, mermaids, and severed hands.
            (“Antwerpen” is the archaic version of the Dutch “Hand werpen”, or
            “hand throwing”, after the legend of a Roman soldier’s encounter with
            a giant, which left the giant dead and missing one remarkably aerodynamic
            hand, and left the soldier the owner of a newly vacant riverside plot
            of land. Turns out if you throw enough body parts into rivers, you get
            to build towns by them.)
          </p>
          <p>
            The trip was fantastic, the classes were rich and interesting, and the
            people I met and studied with were even more so. I highly recommend
            running off to foreign places and learning things which you’re entirely
            unqualified for, if ever you get the chance; you’ll surprise yourself
            with how quickly you adapt and how much you learn.
